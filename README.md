# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

A CNN-based deep learning web application to detect plant diseases from leaf images.

## 🚀 Features
- Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- 92%+ validation accuracy
- Streamlit web interface
- Real-time prediction with confidence score

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- OpenCV

## 📂 Dataset
PlantVillage Dataset (subset of 4–5 classes)

## ▶️ Run Locally

1. Clone repository:
   git clone <your-repo-url>

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run app:
   streamlit run app.py

4. ⚠️ Note: The trained model file is not included due to GitHub size limits. 
Train the model using `train.py` to generate `plant_disease_model.keras`.

## 📸 Demo
Upload a leaf image to detect disease and view prediction confidence.
